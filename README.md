# Password Generator Starter Code
Third assignment for UCLA boot camp submitted by katcontreras


Good start! You have a good start here. There are just a few technical acceptance criteria missing that I have listed below.
* Application doesn't generate valid password based on password options
* Application prompts user for password length and if they would like to include lowercased, uppercased, numeric, and special characters
* Application doesn't require minimum password length of 8 character
* Application doesn't require maximum password length of 128 characters
* Repo doesn't include a high quality README with screenshots, a description, link to deployed application
If you need additional help remember to reach out to your instructional staff and tutors. They can help you with anything you need regarding this assignment. Thanks
